# Determinants of speed dating decisions

In this project, we examined how people made dating decisions based on various attributes of their dates and the differences between women and men in considering various attributes.

This was a semester-long group project for the INFO2950 Intro to Data Science course in the fall of 2023. We had two members, Flavia Jiang and Rachel Wang, who contributed equally to the project. We finished this project with valuable help from the instructor, Prof. Allison Koenecke, and the TAs.
